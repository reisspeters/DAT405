In this project i create a piece of coding that follows the cursor on the
canvas when pressed, enabling the user to draw on the page freely. This was
inspired from the Mouse Interaction exercise that we did in class, as well as
the exercises we did on using random fill on the loops.I also wanted to
incorporate shapes into the coding as well as a random function that would be
used on these shapes.

There must also be some kind of reset and save button. A reset button would be
needed so that the user can reset the canvas and create another one if they
don't like what they have created. Whereas a save button would be needed so
that the user can save the canvas if they like what they've created.

i feel like the way in which the user should change the shape should be done
with the mouse buttons (LEFT,RIGHT,CENTER). This would increase the user
experience as they don't have to press any keys while creating they're canvas.
Similarly i want to use the acceleration functions in p5 that would allow me to
change the size of the shape without the use of any button or key presses. In
doing this, it will create a more organic motion to the final code.
